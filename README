This is avocado-static-checks, a collection of opinionated scripts
that apply static quality checks to (mostly) Python code.  It was
created to make the style of the Avocado (testing framework) and
related projects consistent.

These scripts simply wrap the functionality present in other tools,
but add command line options or configuration files to make it ready
to use, as long as one agrees with the choices made here.  If you
don't quite agree with the exact configuration of checks here, it
should be possible to overwrite the behavior of specific checks.
